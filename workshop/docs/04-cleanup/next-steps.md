# Next steps

## 🎉 You're Ready to Build Customer PoCs!

You now have everything you need to accelerate customer engagements.

### What You Can Now Do

- ✅ **Deploy in minutes**: Infrastructure as Code makes setup repeatable
- ✅ **Generate any scenario**: AI creates realistic data for any industry
- ✅ **Show document intelligence**: Foundry IQ with agentic retrieval
- ✅ **Show data intelligence**: Fabric IQ with natural language queries
- ✅ **Show combined power**: Orchestrator Agent answers complex questions

### Quick Reference: Building a Customer PoC

```bash
# Before each customer meeting, generate their scenario:
python scripts/00_build_solution.py --clean \
  --industry "Customer's Industry" \
  --usecase "Brief description of their use case"
```

**Example for an insurance customer:**
```bash
python scripts/00_build_solution.py --clean \
  --industry "Insurance" \
  --usecase "Property and casualty insurance with claims processing, policy management, and fraud detection"
```

### Talking Points for Customer Conversations

| Customer Question | Your Answer |
|-------------------|-------------|
| "How long to implement?" | Solution accelerator gets you to PoC in hours, production in weeks |
| "Does it work with our data?" | Connects to any documents and Fabric/SQL data sources |
| "How accurate is it?" | Agentic retrieval plans and validates answers, cites sources |
| "Is it secure?" | Enterprise security with Entra ID, runs in your Azure tenant |

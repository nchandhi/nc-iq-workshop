# Choose Industry & Use Case

## Gathering Customer Context

Before generating a PoC, gather these details for your use case:

| Question | What to Capture |
|----------|-----------------|
| "What industry are you in?" | Retail, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Finance, etc. |
| "What's the business process?" | The workflow they want to improve |
| "What questions do users ask?" | The natural language queries they need answered |
| "Where does the info live?" | Documents (policies) vs. databases (metrics) |

## Defining Your Scenario

### Industry

Keep it simple and specific:

| ✅ Good | ❌ Too Vague |
|---------|-------------|
| Retail | Business |
| Healthcare | Services |
| Manufacturing | Industry |
| Insurance | Finance stuff |

### Use Case

Describe the specific business context:

| ✅ Good | ❌ Too Vague |
|---------|-------------|
| "Fashion e-commerce with seasonal collections and loyalty program" | "Online store" |
| "Hospital patient scheduling and insurance verification" | "Healthcare" |
| "Auto parts manufacturing with quality control and supplier management" | "Factory" |
| "Commercial property insurance claims processing" | "Insurance company" |

!!! tip "The More Specific, The Better"
    The AI uses your description to generate:
    
    - Appropriate entity names (e.g., "Claims" vs "Orders")
    - Realistic data relationships
    - Industry-specific document topics
    - Relevant sample questions

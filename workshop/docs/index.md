## What You'll Build

An intelligent AI agent that:

- **Creates knowledge bases** from documents with agentic retrieval
- **Defines business ontology** to understand entities and relationships  
- **Queries data** using natural language over documents and structured data
- **Combines both** to answer complex business questions

# Overview

A strong PoC helps customers envision the impact of solutions on their business. It moves the conversation from "interesting idea" to "let's explore this." But creating something that feels relevant can take weeks of custom work: infrastructure, data pipelines, integrations, and tailored scenarios that reflect their challenges.

This workshop helps you learn how to use solution accelerators to solve that by deploying industry-tailored scenarios quickly so you can demonstrate real value from the first conversation.

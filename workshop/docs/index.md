# Overview

A strong PoC helps customers envision the impact of solutions on their business. It moves the conversation from "interesting idea" to "let's explore this." But creating something that feels relevant can take weeks of custom work: infrastructure, data pipelines, integrations, and tailored scenarios that reflect their challenges.

This workshop helps you learn how to use solution accelerators to solve that by deploying industry-tailored scenarios quickly so you can demonstrate real value from the first conversation.

## Let's build it together

In this workshop, we'll deploy an AI solution using Fabric IQ and Foundry IQ, then customize it for your use case.

Powered by **Microsoft Fabric** and **Microsoft Foundry**:

- **Fabric IQ**: Translates natural language into SQL queries via ontology
- **Foundry IQ**: Searches documents using agentic retrieval (plan, iterate, reflect)
- **Multi-Tool Agent**: Routes questions to the right source automatically

## Workshop flow

| Step | Description | Time |
|------|-------------|------|
| **1. Deploy solution** | Deploy Microsoft Foundry + Fabric & run with Retail demo | ~15 min |
| **2. Customize for your use case** | Generate industry-specific data and demo | ~20 min |
| **3. Deep dive** | Technical deep dive for Q&A | ~15 min |
| **4. Cleanup** | Delete Azure resources | ~5 min |

!!! tip "Before a PoC"
    1. Complete **Step 1** once to deploy and see it working
    2. Run **Step 2** to customize for your use case
    3. Review **Step 3** to prepare for technical questions

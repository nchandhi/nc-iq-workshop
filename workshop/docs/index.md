# Overview

A good PoC helps customers envision the impact of a solution on their business. It shifts the conversation from just an "interesting idea" to real "exploration". The challenge is that creating a PoC that feels relevant can take weeks of custom work. It requires infrastructure, data pipelines, integrations, and tailored scenarios that reflect their specific challenges.

This workshop helps you learn how to use solution accelerators to solve that by deploying industry-tailored scenarios quickly so you can demonstrate real value from the first conversation.

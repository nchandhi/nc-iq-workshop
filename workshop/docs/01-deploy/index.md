# Deploy solution

This step deploys the core infrastructure and runs the solution with a default scenario so you can see it working end-to-end.

## Architecture

<!-- TODO: Add architecture diagram image here -->
![Architecture Diagram](../assets/architecture.png)

The solution combines Microsoft Fabric and Microsoft Foundry to create an AI solution that can answer questions using both structured data and unstructured documents:

- **Microsoft Fabric** provides the data layer with Lakehouse, Warehouse, and the Fabric IQ semantic layer for natural language to SQL translation
- **Microsoft Foundry** hosts the AI agents, including Foundry IQ for document retrieval and the Multi-Tool Agent that orchestrates both capabilities
- **Azure AI Services** powers the language models (GPT-4o-mini) and embeddings
- **Azure AI Search** stores document vectors for semantic retrieval

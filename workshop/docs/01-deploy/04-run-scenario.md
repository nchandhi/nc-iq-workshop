# Build solution

## Run the Full Pipeline

One command builds the solution including data processing and agent creation:

```bash
python scripts/00_build_solution.py --from 02
```

This uses the `data/default` folder and runs all setup steps:

| Step | What Happens | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| 02 | Setup Fabric workspace | ~30s |
| 03 | Load data into Fabric | ~1min |
| 04 | Generate NL2SQL prompt | ~5s |
| 05 | Create Fabric Data Agent | ~30s |
| 06 | Upload documents to AI Search | ~1min |
| 07a | Create Orchestrator Agent | ~10s |

!!! tip "No Fabric License?"
    If you don't have access to Microsoft Fabric, you can still run the workshop using azure services only:
    
    ```bash
    python scripts/00_build_solution.py --foundry-only
    ```
    
    This skips Fabric setup (steps 02-05) and creates an agent in Microsoft Foundry only.

## Expected Output

```

You: How many outages occurred last month?

Agent: Based on the database, there were 16 network outages recorded 
       in January 2024.

You: What are the policies for notifying customers of outages?

Agent: According to our Customer Service Policies document:
       
       - Customers must be notified within 15 minutes of confirmed outage
       - Use SMS, email, and app notifications for affected customers
       - Provide estimated restoration time when available
       - Send updates every 30 minutes during extended outages
       
       [Source: customer_service_policies.pdf]

You: Which outages exceeded the maximum duration defined in our policy?

Agent: Let me check the outage data against our policy thresholds...

       Based on a 4-hour (240 minute) maximum duration policy, these 
       outages exceeded the threshold:
       
       | Outage ID | Duration (min) | Impact Level |
       |-----------|----------------|--------------|
       | OUT011    | 472            | Medium       |
       | OUT004    | 446            | Low          |
       | OUT007    | 445            | Low          |
       | OUT005    | 417            | Medium       |
       | OUT003    | 411            | Low          |
       
       5 outages exceeded the policy maximum duration.

You: quit
```

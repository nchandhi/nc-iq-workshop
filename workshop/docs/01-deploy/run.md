# Run Default Scenario

## Run the Full Pipeline

One command builds everything:

```bash
python scripts/00_build_solution.py
```

This runs all steps automatically:

| Step | What Happens | Time |
|------|--------------|------|
| 01 | Load Retail sample data | ~10s |
| 02 | Setup Fabric workspace | ~30s |
| 03 | Load data into Fabric | ~1min |
| 04 | Generate NL2SQL prompt | ~5s |
| 05 | Create Fabric Data Agent | ~30s |
| 06 | Upload documents to AI Search | ~1min |
| 07a | Create Multi-Tool Agent | ~10s |

You: How many products do we have?

Agent: Based on the database, we currently have 16 products in our catalog
       across 4 categories: Electronics, Apparel, Home & Kitchen, and Sports.

You: Which electronics products have low stock that might need reordering?

Agent: Let me check the inventory data against reorder points...

       These electronics products are at or below their reorder point:
       
       | Product | Stock | Reorder Point | Status |
       |---------|-------|---------------|--------|
       | Wireless Headphones | 45 | 50 | Reorder needed |
       | Smartwatch Pro | 22 | 30 | Reorder needed |
       
       Recommend placing purchase orders for these items.

You: exit

## What You'll Demonstrate

| Component | Technology | Customer Value |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Sample Data | AI-Generated | Realistic demo tailored to customer's industry |
| Business Ontology | Fabric IQ | Natural language queries over business data |
| Knowledge Base | Foundry IQ | Intelligent search over policies & documents |
| AI Agent | Multi-Tool Agent | Single interface combining both sources |

## Your PoC journey

### Module 01: Deploy solution (do once)

Deploy infrastructure and run with pre-built **Retail / E-Commerce** data:

- Deploy **Microsoft Foundry** and Azure resources (AI Services, AI Search, Storage)
- Configure **Microsoft Fabric** connection
- Configure your environment
- See the agent working with sample Retail data
- Takes ~15 minutes

### Module 02: Customize for your use case (repeat)

Generate custom data for **each use case**:

| Customer Industry | Use Case Example | Demo Questions |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Retail | Product catalog + return policies | "What's our return policy for electronics over $500?" |
| Manufacturing | Equipment data + maintenance docs | "Which machines are overdue for maintenance per our schedule?" |
| Healthcare | Patient records + compliance docs | "Do we have capacity for emergency appointments today?" |
| Finance | Account data + lending policies | "Which loan applications meet our approval criteria?" |
| Insurance | Claims data + policy documents | "What's the status of claims filed this week vs our SLA?" |
| **Customer X** | **Their data + Their docs** | **Their burning questions** |

!!! tip "Pre-PoC prep"
    Run Module 02 before your PoC. Enter the industry and a brief use case description. The AI generates realistic sample data, documents, and test questions tailored to your scenario.

### Module 03: How it works

Prepare for technical questions in customer conversations:

- **Foundry IQ** — How agentic retrieval plans, iterates, and reflects
- **Fabric IQ** — How ontology translates business questions to SQL
- **Multi-Tool Agent** — How the agent decides which source to query
